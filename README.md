### About Me 
Hi! I am a first-generation student at Loyola University Maryland, where I am completing my final year of study.

Throughout my college career, I have gained proficiency in Access, ArcGIS, Tableau, Oracle, and SAP ERP. My technical skills include Java, Python, and SQL, which I’ve applied across academic and project work. In addition, I have obtained certifications in SAS through Loyola University Maryland’s Academic Specialization in Business Intelligence and Analytics, SQL from Loyola University Maryland, and Microsoft Specialist Excel 2019 Associate.

Beyond academics, I work as a ramp agent at the airport. I also love immersing myself in books of different genres and exploring new shows during my free time.
