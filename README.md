### About Me 
Hi! I am a first-generation student at Loyola University Maryland, where I am completing my final year of study.

Throughout my college career, I have gained proficiency in Access, ArcGIS, Tableau, Oracle, and SAP ERP. My technical skills include Java, Python, and SQL, which I’ve applied across academic and project work. In addition, I have obtained certifications in SAS through Loyola University Maryland’s Academic Specialization in Business Intelligence and Analytics, SQL from Loyola University Maryland, and Microsoft Specialist Excel 2019 Associate.

Beyond academics, I work as a ramp agent at the airport. I also love immersing myself in books of different genres and exploring new shows during my free time.

### Projects

#### Grade Calculator Program

**Summary**
This project created a fully validated Python grade calculator that processes any number of students, ensures correct user input, calculates weighted averages, and reports both individual results and the final overall class average.

#### Grade Calculator Program Report
**Initial Project Idea**
This project originated from the challenge of understanding how grades are evaluated in a typical college course. The original version of the program could only process one student and allowed users to enter incorrect or unrealistic values. I set out to create a more effective, user-friendly solution that enforced valid input ranges and allowed the user to evaluate an entire class in one program run.

**Tools I Used**
- Python
- OnlineGBD
- Fundamental control structures such as while loops, nested loops, and formatted print statements

**Challenges I Faced**
Input validation became the challenge. I had to redesign the code so that invalid quiz weights, assessment weights, or scores would trigger repeated prompts until the user entered acceptable values. 

**Other Resources**
I used Unit 3 CS105 lecture materials, previous assessments, and Python documentation for reference.

**Result**
My goal was to build a more robust, accurate grade calculator while improving user experience. I successfully created a program that validates all inputs, processes any number of students, clearly displays all results, and calculates the overall class average before terminating.

#### Student Records & Transcript Generator Report
**Initial Project Idea**
The goal of this project was to simulate a functional college records system. I set out to build a small but realistic database that could store student information, track academic performance across multiple semesters, and generate polished transcripts

**Tools I Used**
- Microsoft Access
- Relational database concepts
- Calculated fields
- Report wizard inside Access

**Challenges I Faced**
The challenge I faced was learning how to correctly use the report wizard and the formatting of the transcripts. Since it was a tool inside of Access I had not used before, it was a learning curve with using it and correctly adding the calculated field of the overall GPA.

**Other Resources**
I use my instructor's video example to understand how to use the report wizard inside of Access and how to format it correctly. 

**Result**
In the finished project, I created: 
- A student table with 10 fictional students
- A grades table with multi-year course data for two students
- Two fully formatted transcript reports, each exported as a PDF

#### Inventory Manager & Budget Analysis Workbook

**Summary**
This project expanded my Excel Inventory Manager by adding visualizations, profitability analysis, and a full budgeting system to support business decisions for El Pulgacito Dulcery, including performance charts and financial tracking.

#### Inventory Manager & Budget Analysis Workbook Report
**Initial Project Idea**
This project began with the need to understand product profitability and business sustainability for my fictional candy business, El Pulgacito Dulcery. While the original Inventory Manager stored basic product information, I expanded it to answer deeper business questions:
- Which candy items generate the most profit?
- How efficiently am I budgeting and spending?
- How can finances and inventory data be communicated clearly for investors or stakeholders?

**Tools I Used**
- Excel
- Charts
- Cell Formulas
- Separate worksheet design organization

**Challenges I Faced**
A challenge I faced was figuring out what was the most effective way to tell a story to my shareholders and the type of chart I would do it with. I also needed to choose what was the storying I'm trying to tell with all the data I had. 

**Other Resources**
I relied on my previous experience with Excel as I'm certified in using Excel by my school.

**Result**
 The final result includes an inventory manager sheet, a budget tracker sheet, and a budget analysis sheet.
